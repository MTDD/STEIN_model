MODEL INFORMATION

Quantifying erosion rates in high mountain areas is not straightforward due to the stochastic processes 
which often dictate alpine erosion rates. Among those, frost-cracking and permafrost thaw both contribute 
to erosion rates in cold, high-alpine regions, but the relative contributions of both are not well-constrained. 
The STEIN model (stochastically-eroding in situ cosmogenic nuclide model) is a 1D numerical model that 
simulates surface concentrations of cosmogenic Be-10, C-14, and He-3, alongside the bedrock thermal field,
under variable erosion rates and types. Simulations can evolve under the following erosion types: “stochastic,” 
“uniform,” "episodic," and "no erosion." Each non-uniform erosion scenario is accompanied by a uniformly-
eroding output at the Be-10 derived erosion rate.

To run the model, open and run the code "master_script_STEIN." 

The scripts will generate a sequence of output files. The model can take some time for each individual 
evaluation, depending on the integration time (total model time) input.
